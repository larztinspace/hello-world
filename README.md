# hello-world
Hello great big world of wonder!

Hi, I'm larztinspace, at least at the moment I could also be 
larztinthewoods, larztatsea, larztinthesupermarket. I'm sure 
you understand. It's not that I come from the landofthelarzt, 
or that I'm a larztcause, I just kept going with this pun.
That's all.

Ok, that is not all. Because I deleted something and then 
realized I didn't need to delete it because I was confused. 
so now I've made another branch and hopefully will understand 
better. And commiting and merging will be clear as crystal. 
Let's hope. Also, nice 404 page GitHub!
